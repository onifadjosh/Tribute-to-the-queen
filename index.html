                Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in <br>
                Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke & <br>
                Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen <br>
                Elizabeth). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 <Br>
                upon the abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII, <br>
                making Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was <br>
                educated privately at home and began to undertake <br>
                public duties during the Second World War, serving <br>
                in the Auxiliary Territorial Service.

            <p>
                In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a <br>
                former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their <br>
                marriage lasted 73 years until his death in April 2021. <br>
                They had four children: Charles III; Anne, Princess <br>
                Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince <br>
                Edward, Earl of Wessex. Elizabeth II was Queen of <br>
                the United Kingdom from 6 February 1952 until her <br>
                death in 2022. Her reign of 70 years and 214 days <br>
                was the longest of any British monarch and the <br>
                second-longest recorded of any monarch of a <br>
                sovereign country. At the time of her death, <br>
                Elizabeth was also Queen of 14 other Commonwealth <br>
                realms in addition to the United Kingdom.
